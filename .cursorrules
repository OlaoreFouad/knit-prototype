Knit Prototype Conventions

- Glossary:
  - Knit: a friend group in this product.
  - Member: a person in a Knit.
  - Invite: a link/token letting a person join a Knit.
  - Availability: time preferences a member shares, designed to be persistent but expirable.

- Frontend:
  - Framework: Angular (keep existing NgModule structure).
  - Styling: SCSS only (no CSS files).
  - Routing: use clear, semantic routes, e.g. /create-knit, /invite/:id, /availability-setup, /knit/:id.
  - State: create a dedicated service to manage Knit, Members, Invites, and Availability.

- Prototype persistence:
  - Use localStorage for now; namespace keys with knit:*.
  - Store availability with an expiration timestamp and sweep expired entries.
  - Avoid external analytics in this prototype.

- Privacy & UX (prototype-level):
  - Availability is visible only within the relevant Knit views.
  - Keep flows short: create-knit -> share invite -> join -> availability setup -> dashboard.
  - Prefer accessible, mobile-first UI.

- Code style:
  - Descriptive names, no cryptic abbreviations.
  - Keep components focused; push data logic into services.
  - Add minimal unit tests for critical services and flows.
